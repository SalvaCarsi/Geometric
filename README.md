### Imersivo app

I have used Dan Abramov react-hot-boilerplate. It is a very minimalistic boilerplate that sets up babel, express and react. I have choosen this one to start almost from scratch and add later on the different features as needed.

##Features

- Redux: https://github.com/reactjs/redux
- styled-components: https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components

### Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/gaearon/imersivo.git
cd imersivo/
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
