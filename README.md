### Imersivo app

I have used Dan Abramov react-hot-boilerplate. It is a very minimalistic boilerplate that sets up babel, express, react, slint and hot reloading (I have disable the last feature as it has some issues when developing with Webstorm Idea IDE as it's my case). 

I have chosen this boilerplate to start almost from scratch and add later on the different features as needed.

##Features

- Redux: https://github.com/reactjs/redux
- styled-components: https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components

TODO 
- Prop validation and prop constructor for the containers and components
- Choose a font similar to the one given in the example
- Implement test with Jest and Enzyme
- Internationalization

### Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/gaearon/imersivo.git
cd imersivo/
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
